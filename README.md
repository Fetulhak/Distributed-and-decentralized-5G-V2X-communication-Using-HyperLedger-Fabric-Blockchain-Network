# Distributed-and-decentralized-5G-V2X-communication-Using-HyperLedger-Fabric-Blockchain-Network
A Blockchain based 5G V2X communication platform in which the main entities in 5G V2X communication including the 5G core network, the Public Key Infrastructure, the ITS-Station (vehicles, pedestrians, road side units and other authorities on the road) are integrated in a decentralized and interoperable manner. The blockchain network used is the Hyperledger Fabric supported by the Hyperledger Composer Framework.

###  About the project
- This project is implemented using existing Fabric sample Test network samples from Hyperledger Fabric git repository with my own customization logic
- Created four channels, 10 organizations, a single orderer with each organization having a single peer node
- Developed fast and efficient chaincode written in Java to manage, process, and then store V2X related information on 5G V2X communication in the ledger
- Used the internal CouchDB database for world state which allows for quick data retrieval and operation
